# PrepFlow Session Checkpoint — 2026-07-20

This is a temporary operational checkpoint for the next development session. The durable architectural authorities remain `docs/ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md`, `docs/RESTART_PACKET.md`, and `docs/CONTINUITY_REBUILD_PLAN.md`.

## Verified branch state

- Repository: `bins-projects/prepflow-dev`
- Branch: `docs/continuity-rebuild`
- Current verified head before this checkpoint: `f414d80`
- Local branch matched `origin/docs/continuity-rebuild`.
- Working tree was clean.

## Completed this session

1. Removed obsolete DOCX prototype and dependencies at `0ed062f`.
2. Removed legacy Python desktop, terminal, PyInstaller, and Windows-build stack at `3839243`.
3. Updated Restart Packet after cleanup at `7ad4dc4`.
4. Changed the compiler to preserve incoming question IDs and generate Pack-namespaced IDs for new questions. The implementation was completed through `f302c70`.
5. Migrated all three official Packs to globally unique IDs at `f414d80`.

## Permanent question ID state

Current ID format:

```text
PFQ-<pack_id>-<nine-digit sequence>
```

Examples:

```text
PFQ-fundamentals-000000001
PFQ-medical_surgical-000000001
PFQ-pharmacy-000000001
```

Compiler rules now implemented:

```text
Existing incoming ID → preserve it
No incoming ID       → generate a Pack-namespaced ID
```

Verified migration results:

- Fundamentals: 1,040 questions
- Medical-Surgical: 1,443 questions
- Pharmacy: 1,238 questions
- Total questions: 3,721
- Unique IDs: 3,721
- Missing IDs: none
- Cross-Pack collisions: none
- Only question ID fields changed during Pack migration
- Full Python suite: 72 passed

## Browser reference finding

The browser currently does not use question IDs for quiz references. It creates and saves references in this form:

```javascript
{
  packPath,
  questionIndex
}
```

`currentQuestion()` reloads the Pack and resolves the question with:

```javascript
pack.questions[reference.questionIndex]
```

The same reference objects are reused by:

- the shuffled session question list;
- missed-question tracking;
- the review queue;
- the current review question;
- local save/resume state.

Because PrepFlow is unreleased and only a few temporary local saves exist, backward compatibility with version-2 saved sessions is not required. Old saves may be intentionally rejected or cleared once.

## Exact next milestone

Replace browser question references from:

```text
packPath + questionIndex
```

to:

```text
packPath + questionId
```

The milestone must include:

1. create references with `questionId` in `startQuiz()`;
2. resolve questions by permanent ID rather than array position;
3. update missed/review/save references through the shared reference format;
4. bump saved-session version and deliberately reject or clear old version-2 saves;
5. run the 72-test Python suite;
6. perform a real browser smoke test covering quiz start, wrong answer, review, save/quit, and resume;
7. commit and push as one coherent milestone.

Estimated time: approximately 30–45 minutes. Do not start when there is not enough time to complete verification, commit, and push.

## Safe resume instruction

At the next session:

1. inspect this checkpoint in GitHub;
2. verify branch head and `git status`;
3. inspect the current `web/app.js` reference creation, resolution, and saved-session code;
4. make the browser reference migration as one focused milestone.

The pre-rebuild repository remains preserved by tag:

```text
before-continuity-rebuild-2026-07-20
```

### Backlog addition

Add a small, unobtrusive visible question reference to the quiz or rationale view so screenshots can identify the exact permanent question ID. Keep it visually secondary and do not expose internal filenames or developer terminology.

### Tenth Phase D extraction completed

Completed through:

```text
d96c847  refactor: extract browser display rules
b4b9d39  refactor: complete browser display rule integration
```

Implemented:

- added `web/display-rules.js` with tested quiz-position, running-score, block-summary, and final-summary text helpers;
- added `web/display-rules.test.html` with 12 normal, review, score, completion, mastery, and singular/plural cases;
- integrated the tested helpers throughout the live quiz and summary paths;
- completed a final inspection and replaced the one remaining inline running-score formatter after answer submission.

Verification completed:

- all 12 display-rule browser tests passed;
- all 72 Python tests passed after the batched integration and after the final cleanup;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- local, private, and public branch heads all matched `b4b9d394266689126e0cc6e1f4284f70adbb3849`;
- working tree was clean.

### Phase D complete

The final inspection found no further pure behavior unit worth extracting from `web/app.js`. Remaining code is primarily DOM coordination, Pack loading, state transfer, and event wiring. Further extraction would add indirection without enough safety or testing value.

### Exact next milestone

Move to the next continuity-rebuild phase by inspecting `docs/CONTINUITY_REBUILD_PLAN.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md`, and the current browser structure. Select one coherent next milestone from the documented plan. Keep the visible permanent question-reference item as a separate small UI backlog change unless the next phase explicitly calls for it.
