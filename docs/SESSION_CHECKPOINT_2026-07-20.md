# PrepFlow Session Checkpoint — 2026-07-20

This is a temporary operational checkpoint for the next development session. The durable architectural authorities remain `docs/ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md`, `docs/RESTART_PACKET.md`, and `docs/CONTINUITY_REBUILD_PLAN.md`.

## Verified branch state

- Repository: `bins-projects/prepflow-dev`
- Branch: `docs/continuity-rebuild`
- Current verified head before this checkpoint: `f414d80`
- Local branch matched `origin/docs/continuity-rebuild`.
- Working tree was clean.

## Completed this session

1. Removed obsolete DOCX prototype and dependencies at `0ed062f`.
2. Removed legacy Python desktop, terminal, PyInstaller, and Windows-build stack at `3839243`.
3. Updated Restart Packet after cleanup at `7ad4dc4`.
4. Changed the compiler to preserve incoming question IDs and generate Pack-namespaced IDs for new questions. The implementation was completed through `f302c70`.
5. Migrated all three official Packs to globally unique IDs at `f414d80`.

## Permanent question ID state

Current ID format:

```text
PFQ-<pack_id>-<nine-digit sequence>
```

Examples:

```text
PFQ-fundamentals-000000001
PFQ-medical_surgical-000000001
PFQ-pharmacy-000000001
```

Compiler rules now implemented:

```text
Existing incoming ID → preserve it
No incoming ID       → generate a Pack-namespaced ID
```

Verified migration results:

- Fundamentals: 1,040 questions
- Medical-Surgical: 1,443 questions
- Pharmacy: 1,238 questions
- Total questions: 3,721
- Unique IDs: 3,721
- Missing IDs: none
- Cross-Pack collisions: none
- Only question ID fields changed during Pack migration
- Full Python suite: 72 passed

## Browser reference finding

The browser currently does not use question IDs for quiz references. It creates and saves references in this form:

```javascript
{
  packPath,
  questionIndex
}
```

`currentQuestion()` reloads the Pack and resolves the question with:

```javascript
pack.questions[reference.questionIndex]
```

The same reference objects are reused by:

- the shuffled session question list;
- missed-question tracking;
- the review queue;
- the current review question;
- local save/resume state.

Because PrepFlow is unreleased and only a few temporary local saves exist, backward compatibility with version-2 saved sessions is not required. Old saves may be intentionally rejected or cleared once.

## Exact next milestone

Replace browser question references from:

```text
packPath + questionIndex
```

to:

```text
packPath + questionId
```

The milestone must include:

1. create references with `questionId` in `startQuiz()`;
2. resolve questions by permanent ID rather than array position;
3. update missed/review/save references through the shared reference format;
4. bump saved-session version and deliberately reject or clear old version-2 saves;
5. run the 72-test Python suite;
6. perform a real browser smoke test covering quiz start, wrong answer, review, save/quit, and resume;
7. commit and push as one coherent milestone.

Estimated time: approximately 30–45 minutes. Do not start when there is not enough time to complete verification, commit, and push.

## Safe resume instruction

At the next session:

1. inspect this checkpoint in GitHub;
2. verify branch head and `git status`;
3. inspect the current `web/app.js` reference creation, resolution, and saved-session code;
4. make the browser reference migration as one focused milestone.

The pre-rebuild repository remains preserved by tag:

```text
before-continuity-rebuild-2026-07-20
```

## Update — 2026-07-21

### Browser permanent-reference migration completed

Completed at:

```text
e2ec845  refactor: use permanent question IDs in browser sessions
```

The browser now uses `packPath + questionId` references, resolves questions by permanent ID, saves version 3 sessions, and clears incompatible older saves.

Verification completed:

- `git diff --check` passed;
- all 72 Python tests passed;
- all 3,721 official Pack IDs are present and unique;
- real browser smoke test passed for quiz start, incorrect answer, review, save/quit, and resume;
- commit was pushed to and verified on `origin/docs/continuity-rebuild`.

### Phase D inventory completed

Completed at:

```text
dc7afdf  docs: add Phase D browser behavior inventory
```

The inventory identified answer normalization and exact-set grading as the smallest safe pure behavior unit to extract from `web/app.js`.

### First Phase D extraction completed

Completed at:

```text
5682771  refactor: extract browser quiz grading rules
```

Implemented:

- added `web/quiz-rules.js` with pure answer normalization, correct-answer resolution, and exact-set grading;
- added `web/quiz-rules.test.html` with MC and SATA grading checks;
- loaded the rules before `web/app.js`;
- updated live quiz grading to use the extracted rules;
- removed the temporary integration helper after use.

Verification completed:

- all browser rules tests passed;
- all 72 Python tests passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- real browser smoke test passed, including answer flow and Restart Quiz;
- local, private, and public branch heads all matched `56827713cd64e1bf6940aab7bd64711c54c2bdfe`;
- working tree was clean.

### Second Phase D extraction completed

Completed at:

```text
dd5e0a2  refactor: extract browser session calculations
```

Implemented:

- added `web/session-rules.js` with pure block-count, block-end, question-position, and first-pass percentage calculations;
- added `web/session-rules.test.html` covering empty, complete, partial, capped, and rounded cases;
- loaded the session rules before `web/app.js`;
- updated the live quiz to use the extracted calculations;
- removed the temporary integration helper after use.

Verification completed:

- all session-rule browser tests passed;
- all 72 Python tests passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- live browser smoke test passed for block count, question numbering, final percentage, and Restart Quiz;
- local, private, and public branch heads all matched `dd5e0a2e603bb90d66aff0c946b5fd05f935a800`;
- working tree was clean.

### Third Phase D extraction completed

Completed at:

```text
02f3bb4  refactor: extract browser summary decisions
```

Implemented:

- added `web/summary-rules.js` with the pure decision for review, next block, or finish;
- added `web/summary-rules.test.html` covering misses, mastery, remaining blocks, and final-block completion;
- loaded the summary rules before `web/app.js`;
- updated the live block-summary button to use the extracted action and label;
- removed the temporary integration helper after use.

Verification completed:

- all eight summary-rule browser tests passed;
- all 72 Python tests passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- integration was verified directly against the live `showBlockSummary()` path;
- a manual click-through smoke test was deferred because the user was unavailable;
- local, private, and public branch heads all matched `02f3bb4fcf0553c83aa158ea41d29b48a5a0e16e`;
- working tree was clean.

### Backlog addition

Add a small, unobtrusive visible question reference to the quiz or rationale view so screenshots can identify the exact permanent question ID. Keep it visually secondary and do not expose internal filenames or developer terminology.

### Exact next milestone

Continue Phase D with another read-only inspection of `web/app.js`. Extract only the next smallest pure behavior unit that can be tested without changing visible browser flow. Prefer a narrowly scoped review-queue transition, saved-session validation, or display-state helper. Do not begin a broad rewrite. The visible question-reference item remains a separate small UI backlog change.
